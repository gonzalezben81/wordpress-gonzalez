This application allows you to "scrape" data from the internet. You simply place the desired website url into the text box and then select the "html node" to retrieve the desired data. Any user that is not familiar with HTML, CSS, or JAVA can click on the reference links to learn more. When finished scraping your data, you simple name your file and click download to create a text file that will be downloaded to your computer.
