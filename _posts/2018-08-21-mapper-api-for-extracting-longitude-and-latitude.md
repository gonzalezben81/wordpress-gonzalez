The mapper app is an API for extracting latitude and longitude data from addresses in a csv file. Simply add all the addresses you want to retrieve lat and long from and click "Get Coordinates". The data will be stored inÂ  a CSV file to download. You will also be able to Map the coordinates you just retrieved in an interactive map to ensure the reliability of your data.
