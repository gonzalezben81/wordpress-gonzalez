The baseball pitch analysis app allows you to upload pitch data and visualize it using the ggplot2 function in R-Shiny. A sample set is included to download to see how your data needs to be formatted.Â  There are two different plots, one that focuses on the speed of the pitches, and the other that focuses on the type of pitches. You can download additional pitch data from statcast that is used by the MLB.
