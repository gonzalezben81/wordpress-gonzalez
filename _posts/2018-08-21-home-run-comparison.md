This shiny app allows you to compare the home runs and stats of all players in major league baseball since 1876.  The home run comparison tab visualizes the home runs of individual players over their entire career. You can compare great baseball players, like Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth, and then see how they stack up against current and former players as well.
