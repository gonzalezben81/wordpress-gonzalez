The Text Analysis App allows a user to upload a text file and then perform an analysis on the uploaded text. The user is able to create a word cloud, count the number of words in the text, as well as quantify the emotion present in the text. You can also plot the entire emotional valence of a text and download the results for further use. Feel free to leave feedback or suggestions to help improve the app.
